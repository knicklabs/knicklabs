### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Nickolas and this is my personal README. I put this document together with two goals in mind:

1. To help anyone who has to collaborate with me by providing them with some context about who I am and how I work.
2. To encourage folks to reach out to me to ask for help or to say hi.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...

I am a JavaScript Engineer at Help Scout where I work on the web app. I enjoy building new features that help businesses and customer service professionals around the world to deliver exceptional service to their customers. I also enjoy looking for ways to share knowledge internally and improve the quality and maintainability of large code bases.

I strive to maintain a good work-life balance but that doesn't mean I don't get up to anything outside of work. I am currently contributing to the Ready 2 Work research project. I was part of a team that was awarded a 2019 Child-Bright KT Innovation Incubator Grant to develop a pilot online employment readiness platform for self-advocates with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), their families, and professionals who operate programs for people with ASD.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

There's so much to learn! I am always learning something new and I love to talk about what I'm learning and hear about what other people are learning. Seriously, ask me about it or tell me about what you're learning. 

I got my start in programming doing iOS development and I've recently gotten back into it so I've been catching up on the many changes to the ecosystem since I was programming with Objective-C and targeting iOS 4. SwiftUI rekindled my interest. I've been learning that alongside Swift and the iOS 13 SDK.

Another thing about me is that I started but never finished a Computer Science degree. I've been working towards finishing my degree for my own personal satisifaction. I'm currently taking a Systems Analysis course and a Linear Algebra course; the latter is my last math credit!

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on...

Generally, I'm not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment and I'm happily employed. However, if you're doing research at the intersection of Applied Disability Studies and Human Computer Interaction and in need of some technical advice from a software engineering professional regarding mobile or web app development, please do say hi.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with...

I could use some help with building accessible user experiences in web and mobile apps. If you have advice or resources, please send them my way.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about...

- Web and mobile app development
- JavaScript and TypeScript in the browser and on the server
- React and React Native
- Accessibility
- Remote work
- Being a professional software developer
- Transitioning to software development as a second (or nth) career

### ðŸ“« How to reach me...

You can email me at nickolas [at] knicklabs [dot] com. If you know me, you can also call me, send me a text, or chat with me on Slack. My working hours are 9AM-6PM ET Monday-Friday.

### ðŸ˜„ Pronouns...

He/him

### âš¡ Fun fact...

I used to play in a metal band. It was semi-serious but nothing came from it other than good times and a hole in my wallet. We did once get to play a show with Alexisonfire (in their early days). We also got to play a show with Voivod (in their latter days).
