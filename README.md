### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Nickolas. I enjoy collaborating with others to make dependable software and delightful products.

### ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on...

I am a Technical Lead and Staff Software Engineer at Help Scout where I am currently working on the cross-functional Docs Team, which is responsible for building and maintaining tools for our users to create and publish knowledge bases.

I am a collaborator on the Ready2Work Research Project. Our multidisciplinary team was awarded a 2019 Child-Bright KT Innovation Incubator Grant to develop a pilot online employment readiness platform for self-advocates with Autistism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), their families, and professionals who operate programs for people with ASD.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

I've been working on completing the B.Sc. Degree I started and left ten years ago. I am studying Computer Science and have recently taken courses in mathematics, artificial intelligence, and computer architecture and networking. I've really enjoyed expanding my horizons beyond the type of software engineering I do day-to-day. There are whole other areas of the field to enjoy, and apply back to my work.

I had a non-traditional path to working in tech and am happy to talk to anyone looking to break into tech, especially those coming from a non-traditional background. I know how hard it can be to beleive in yourself and find your way.
